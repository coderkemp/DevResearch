Integer takes = 4 Bytes
The size of int[] cannot be changed during runtime
There is a size limitation in int[]

Linked List:
--------------

struct Node
{
    int data;                 //4 bytes
    struct Node *next;        // 4 bytes, the next stores the memory address of the next node
}
 
* size of a Node in linked list is 8 bytes

* What are the advantages of Linked list over array? Why should we use it?
    - There is no size limitation in linkedlist.
    - Insertion/Deletion in linked list is easy.

* Disadvantages of linked list?
    - Sequential access is done in linked list. In an array, you can just access whichever you need like a[2],a[4] etc in O(1) complexity.
    - Extra pointer is used in linked list i.e for the next pointer which takes up extra space.
